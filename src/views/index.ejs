            One of the best communities. Positive chatting, daily challenges, and helpful for people of all skill
            levels.
            Willing to help people if you donâ€™t know how to solve a cube or are trying to improve. If I could give it
            more
            stars I would.

            It's a simple server yet whenever you need help or advice, you can ask it there. It's a place for those who
            are
            just starting with cubing and for those who cube for years, it's one of the better cube servers out there.
